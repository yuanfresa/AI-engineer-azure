Unfortunately there is something wrong with my faceapi resource used before for my project that I could not get the report for that.

# Reflection
I have learned a lot from the project which took me a really long time.
## No permission to create video indexer resource
It took me a while to figure this out since the instruction from the course material is out of dated.

## The permission creating custom form recognizer project
>"Error: Check if you have unexpired read/write/list/delete permission to blob container/blob,"
After trying all the methods listed in this  [Q&A page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/288547/form-recognizer-error-check-if-you-have-unexpired.html?WT.mc_id=udacity_learn-wwl%3F) from Microsoft helpful.

## Excercises are important
The excercises from the courses are important to follow which will make the final project more easier and smoother.
